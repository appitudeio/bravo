title: Migration Guide
description: Migrate from Bootstrap to Bravo with minimal changes. Most markup stays the same, with enhanced behaviors and styling.
group: getting-started

After [installing Bravo](/docs/getting-started/installation/), your existing Bootstrap markup will work immediately.

## Immediate benefits

### Import order solved

Bootstrap requires specific import order to work properly and allow customization. Get it wrong, your build breaks.

Bravo handles all of this internally:
```scss
@import "@appitude/bravo/scss/bravo";
```

Now customizations like the [enhanced color system](/docs/design-tokens/color-system/) just work without worrying about where to place your variables.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Auto-initialization for existing markup:</strong> Import <code>@appitude/bravo/js/dynamicobserver</code> to automatically initialize tooltips, dropdowns, and other components in your existing HTML without changing markup. Learn more about <a href="/docs/javascript/dynamic-observer/">DynamicObserver</a>.
</div>

## What requires attention

### Grid system

Bravo doesn't include grid classes by default. To use the grid:

```scss
@import "@appitude/bravo/scss/bravo";
@import "@appitude/bravo/scss/bravo-grid";  // Adds grid with column-* naming
```

This gives you `.column-*` classes instead of Bootstrap's `.col-*`, plus some improvements like `.flex-auto` and better gutter handling.

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="column-12 column-md-6 column-lg-4">
    <!-- Cleaner than col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### Visual changes to review

* **Headings:** Larger sizes and lighter weights (500 vs 700)
* **Primary color:** `#006AFF` instead of Bootstrap's `#0d6efd`
* **Container gutters:** Responsive instead of fixed

## Removed utilities

To reduce CSS weight, a few rarely-used utilities are not included:

* `.vw-*`, `.vh-*`, `.min-vw-*`, `.min-vh-*`
* `.rounded-4`, `.rounded-5`
